# Make a Person

Fill in the object constructor with the following methods below:

```
getFirstName()
getLastName()
getFullName()
setFirstName(first)
setLastName(last)
setFullName(firstAndLast)
```

The methods that take an argument must accept only one argument and it has to be a string.

These methods must be the only available means of interacting with the object.
